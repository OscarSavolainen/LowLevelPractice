# Practicing Data Structures and Algorithms
Exercises for the Primeagean's Data Structures and Algorithms course: https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/ 

I mainly practiced these in C++, but occasionaly Python if I have a lot to get through / want to practice Python syntax. 
Sometimes I did C++ and then Python, having done so much C++ I was worried my Python would atrophy haha.

## Array: 
Contains the exercises for Arrays (static arrays).

### Search:
Search algos: linear, binary, and a crystall ball example.

### Sorting:
Exercises for sorting algorithms, that work on a static array.

## ArrayBuffer:
TODO

## LinkedList:
Linked List implementation, including a double linked list. Also did a basic stack and queue.

## Recursion:
Some recursion pracices, e.g.

### Maze Solver
An exercise that use a stack and recursion.

### QuickSort
QuickSort algorithm uses recursion.

### A very minimal simple example of recursion.
Probably the simplest example possible.

## Trees:
### Traversal 
- Pre-order,
- In-order,
- Post-order.

### Search:
- Depth-first
- Breadth-first.

## Graphs:
- BFS
- DFS
- Dijkstra (Python)
- How many subgraphs (e.g. islands) (Python)
- Largest component (e.g. largest island) (Python)

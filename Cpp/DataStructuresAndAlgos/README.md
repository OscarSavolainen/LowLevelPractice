# Practicing Data Structures and Algorithms
Exercises for the Primeagean's Data Structures and Algorithms course: https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/ 

## Array: 
Contains the exercises for Arrays (static arrays).

### Search:
Search algos: linear, binary, and a crystall ball example.

### Sorting:
Exercises for sorting algorithms, that work on a static array.

## ArrayBuffer:
TODO

## LinkedList:
Linked List implementation, including a double linked list. Also did a basic stack and queue.

## Recursion
Some recursion pracices, e.g. a Maze Solver exercise that use a stack and recursion, QuickSort, and a very minimal simple example of recursion.

# Trees
Different traversal (Pre-order, in-order and post-order) algorithms and search algorithms (Depth-first and Breadth-first).
